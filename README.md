👩‍🎓 Hey! I'm Itika, a 22 year old software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, building community. My preferred pronouns are **she/her** .

:octocat: I have a soft spot for technology and communities 💖 I am a [**GitHub Campus Expert**](https://githubcampus.expert) and also a part of [**GitHub Education Stream Team**](https://github.blog/2021-03-25-introducing-the-github-education-stream-team/) :octocat:! 

💖 I’m contributing to [**GirlScript Foundation**](https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing) as a open-source contributor for Javascript and Python. 

👩‍💻 Nowadays, I’m learning React Js, MongoDB, and Next.js.  


⚡ Fun fact: I have a Computer Engineering background, but most of the credit goes to Google and Stack Overflow 😪
